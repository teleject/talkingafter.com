Had the good fortune to join [Customers Also Watched](https://customersalsowatched.podbean.com/) to [discuss 1999's _Killer Eye_](https://customersalsowatched.podbean.com/e/the-killer-eye-1999/), much to my misfortune. 

The main driving point of the movie is that a scientist Dr. Jordan Grady (Jonathan Norman) really wants to look into the 8th dimension even if it cost him his wife. It should be noted that to his wife's credit (played by Jacqueline Lovell), she said, "I told you when we got married, I need attention."

While operating on vagrants in his upstairs science lab, his fellow neighbors don't even care that unlicensed science-babble is being conducted in their home. Mostly because they are fried by the plate of pills. They are so fried that they let us know they are fried by saying they are fried more than once to make sure we really get the point. Also, they are in their underwear while being fried. So, that really drives the point home.

Terrible acting and effects along with elementary-level *science-splaining* made this one a chore to watch. Thankfully you don't have to. You can listen to Erika and me as we discuss all what we saw with [The Killer Eye](https://customersalsowatched.podbean.com/e/the-killer-eye-1999/).
