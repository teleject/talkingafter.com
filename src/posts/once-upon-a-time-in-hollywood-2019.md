Quentin Tarantino's flair for fictionalized history returns to the final moments of Hollywoodâ€™s golden age. It's 1969 Los Angeles for his Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) and TV star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) make their way around an industry they hardly recognize anymore. 

Tarantino crafts engaging character vignettes for over two hours.  One gets deeply involved in their relationships and struggles as they age out of Hollywood, yet seeing and working the up and coming talent. So when the final act hits, you're cheering like you haven't in a long time at the theater. 

And, yes, that includes those Marvel movies.

There's nothing that Hollywood loves more than Hollywood. With his firm, but lovingly look at the industry, Tarantino's ninth outing will play well with critics come award season.
