Disney takes itâ€™s beloved animated film classic and places it under a [Russian aging app](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/old-face-app-age-android-ios) for those hi-def wrinkles.

With all the wrinkles, they made only tweaks on the original overall. While seemingly flawlessly executed, I'm remiss as to why there was a need to make this film? Maybe for a new generation of kids that demand better [Homeward Bound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr1dvT8di80) films?

Lion King (2019) a good movie because it was paint by numbers over a great movie, Lion King (1994). 

Only thing missing is a Save Ferris GoFundMe drive for finding Matthew Broderick's contribution in the new version.
